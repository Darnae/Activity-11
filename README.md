# Activity-11
Dice Class


This activity was similar to the previous Milestone Assignment. I was tasked with creating a class of my own, this time with a specific function. This assignment required making a class with methods that roll a pair of dice. Each roll has to be reported, and a special dialogue stating that snakes has occured when that event comes to pass. Included in my files are screenshots, of three test runs. Two of the test runs are of random test, while the third is a screenshot of when the program had eventually reached snake eyes. The first screenshot is of the code, but I have also added the .cs file directly to the Github.
